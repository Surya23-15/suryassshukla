            <h7>Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) was a German politician and dictator who rose to power in the early 1930s. He was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, and later became the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the Nazi Party. Hitler's ideology, known as Nazism, promoted extreme nationalism, racism, and anti-Semitism.</h7>
            <p>Hitler's regime implemented a series of repressive policies, including the suppression of political opposition, censorship, and the persecution of minority groups, particularly Jews. This led to the systematic genocide known as the Holocaust, in which six million Jews and millions of others were killed. Under Hitler's leadership, Germany embarked on an aggressive foreign policy, which eventually led to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Hitler's military campaigns, marked by his blitzkrieg tactics, initially achieved significant territorial gains. However, as the war progressed, Germany faced a series of defeats, leading to the eventual downfall of Hitler's regime.</p>
